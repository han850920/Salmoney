” Salmoney ” is an Web app for loan recording.
We may lend or borrow money in a small amount to our friends, however, we usually forget it because it’s a little things and sometimes may be complex after few transactions.
The app can remind you when you should pay the money back automatically, and only a few easy steps to build a new record.
